  - A note about slides/vimdeck
    - Link to slides
  - Who I am - links
    - Name
    - I work at Adobe
    - jQuery Mobile
  - Why I'm here
    - WebPro
  - What I'm talking about
    - Overview
    - UI patterns: identify, and abstract
    - Decoupling HTML, CSS, and JS
    - Previous methods: good and bad
    - Best practices for reusable Javascript
    - Disclaimer
      - Writing custom components is time-consuming
      - We'll cover what to look for if you don't have time

- UI Patterns
  - Understanding what makes up parts of user interface
  - Once you grab this, you can make abstractions that will impact code organization
  - Examples: Slider, Number Spinner, Tabs, Accordion, Radial Menu (_browser_)
  - *Code* for tabs
  - *Code* for radial menu

- The need to decouple
  - Separation of concerns
  - HTML is structure
  - CSS is style
  - JS is interaction/behavior
  - Style happens only in CSS classes
  - Animation in CSS only
  - JS can be independent of structure
  - Simple *code* example showing separation

- The JS
  - Show example first
  - Black box
  - Framework-based
  - Options
    - Loads of em!
    - Behavior
    - Class Names
    - Selectors
  - Events: communications -> extension
  - *Code* sample with options, and events (_browser_)
  - Second *code* sample using options (_browser_)
  - Third *code* sample using events (_browser_)
  - Inheritance
    - Take advantage of patterns
    - Provide basic initialization

- Closing
  - Git repo of samples/library
    - For messing with only
  - Hit me up on twitter if you have any questions
  - Thanks!
